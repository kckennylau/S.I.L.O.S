"All of the challenge of assembly all of the slowness of the jvm"
A minimalist language which strives to be Turing complete while staying comfortably above the turing tarpit muck
no declaration needed for variables
x = 5 assigns five to x but x started at 0 if it received no value
variables > than 0 are truthy 
no line terminator needed except for new lines
Default behavior of on error resume next
Many more unique features
This language ought to provide speedy and efficient developement, and for more unique features see the specification documents
